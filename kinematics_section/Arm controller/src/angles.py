r"""
To implement this, we are going to neglect the use of z since it is taken care
of by the suction cup.

Step 1: Calculate Î¸ and r from the x, y position using the polar coordinates
    convention. The theta value is then set for angles[0]
Step 2: Calculate angles[1] and (180-angles[2]) such that the effective radius of
    the arm is equal to r. We have a triangle defined with three side lengths
    given: r, L_1 and L_2. We can use the cosine rule twice
Step 3: Calculate angles[3] = - angles[2] - angles[3]

In the diagram below, /\ is the robot arm and ... are guidelines used to define
the angles and the triangle. In this case, angles[2] is negative and angles[1]
and angles[3] are positive.
